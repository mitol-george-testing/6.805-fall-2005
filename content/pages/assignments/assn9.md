Before Class
------------

Please read:

*   Chapters 4 through 6 of Robert O'Harrow's book _No Place to Hide_, which we asked you to get hold of at the beginning of the semester.
*   Find a news article that appeared during past year that involves the issue of personal information on the Web, and be prepared to talk about this in class.

There is no rotisserie writing assignment for this week. Instead, you should be spending time working on your paper: doing research and trying to formulate a thesis. For Lec #10, you'll need to turn in a thesis and an outline of your arguments. See information on papers for details. Don't underestimate how difficult it will be to come up with a good thesis, and start doing the research now.

**Moot court video** : If enough people are interested, we can arrange to show a video of a moot court on the question of whether it would be constitutional to require all encrytion systems to escrow keys with the government. This would take place on Lec #10, from 6 until 8:30. We'll ask for a show of hands in class on Lec #9 to see who would come.
