How Metaphor becomes Law: The Origins of Broadcast Regulation
-------------------------------------------------------------

There is no assignment for this class. You should be working on your papers. Remember that a complete draft of the paper is due 4 days after Lec #11. See information on papers.

Today, Hal will talk about the origins of broadcast regulation as an example of how new technology first becomes understood though metaphors; and while the metaphors may be technically unsound, they can often form the basis for law and regulation of that technology.

For the second part of the class, we'll ask a few of you to give brief oral summaries of your paper and progress in writing. You needn't prepare anything for this presentation (other than to be making good progress on your paper).
